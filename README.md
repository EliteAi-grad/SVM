# SVM
SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.
The goal of SVM is to identify an optimal separating hyperplane which maximizes the margin between different classes of the training data. 

Quadratic programming(QP) involves solving certain mathematical optimization    problems involving quadratic functions, to optimize a multivariate quadratic function subject to linear constraints on the variables. This tool provides an implementation of SVM with QP, the tool has been developed from scratch without using libraries to help reader's understand math behind SVM!
