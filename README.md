# SVM
SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which separates the data into classes.
The goal of SVM is to identify an optimal separating hyperplane which maximizes the margin between different classes of the training data.
